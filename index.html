            <div class="info-domain">
              <p>
                Symbolism was a late 19-century art movement originated with a group of French poets that subsequently spread to figurative arts and music.  It was born in France on the initiative of Jean Moreas who published its Manifesto in “Le Aro” on the 18th of September 1886.
                Symbolism originated in the revolt of certain French poets against the rigid both technique and theme in traditional French poetry. 
                It is inspired by one of Charles Baudelaire’s most famous poems, “Correspondences”. In the latter, the French poet writes that all things have a mysterious bond between them hence often one recalls the other. Baudelaire will be recognized as the master of Symbolism followed later by Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud and Stephane Mallarme. 
                As stated by Rimbaud, in Symbolism the poet is seen as a seer who is able to see deeply, beyond the illusory appearances of sensible reality. The symbolists wish to free poetry from its expository functions and its formalized oratory in order to describe instead the fleeting, immediate sensations of man’s inner life and experience.
                In virtue of this they exploit a poetic language extremely rarefied. This conception leads to several formal innovations:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i> the use of a language made up of symbols, that is, of images and expressions that refer to something mysterious and indefinable;</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i>traditional syntax and metric forms breakdown;</li>
                <li><i class="bi bi-caret-right"></i>normal logical connections are neglected in order to proceed through apparently meaningless juxtapositions;</li>
              </ul>

              <p> <span> Symbolism and Romanticism </span></p>
              </div>
              <p>
              There are some elements of continuity between Romanticism and Symbolism. We can find almost all the same trends and themes in both currents. They tend to depict negative issues of their time having a strong reaction against modern industrial capitalism that destroys traditional life with the use of machinery causing man to have tendencies of monopolistic concentration. 
              The main difference is instead in the vision of the artist. The romantic poet has a titanic and heroic attitude towards reality, with a strong spirituality. Furthermore, Romanticism had constructive ambitions aiming at reflecting the totality and therefore exalting nature and all that was spontaneous. 
              On the other hand, the symbolist is irrational, and flees to an ideal elsewhere with fatigue and weakness that lead him to reflect not on the totality but on the fracture. 

              </p>
            <div class="section-header">
            <p> <span> Themes </span></p>
            </div>
            <div class ="titletheme"><strong> Vague: </strong> </div><p> The sake for the vague and the melancholic is one of the main characteristics of Symbolism. The idea is to see the mysterious bond between symbols in the world that speak to us with a mysterious language understandable just by art.
            This leads to the concept of inaccuracy for which the poem must be like a dream, something indeterminate and indefinite, perhaps with some errors.
             </p>
            <div class ="titletheme"><strong> Musicality:  </strong> </div> <p><i>“Music and still Music”</i> used to say Verlaine. 
            Not by chance great attention is given to the musical and phono symbolic values of the word that can evoke something not only through its meaning but also through its phonos. 
            Whereby poetry becomes music:  a musical flow that spreads without rules in a free and autonomous way. 
            </p>
            <div class ="titletheme"><strong> Escape:  </strong> </div> <p> The rebellion towards reality is expressed in the escape motif. The journey becomes the desire for a happy life which is far from the falsehood of everyday life. 
            </p>
              <div class ="titletheme"><strong> Seer poet:  </strong> </div> <p>The poet becomes a seer, who perceives illuminations through his senses from the unknown. 
              This unknown world is not located outside, but present and hidden in the hell of the soul of the poet himself. 
              Reality is appearance and it is up to him to go further to grasp the secret correspondences. 
              </p>
              <div class ="titletheme"><strong> Spleen:  </strong> </div> <p>It is a form of existential anguish but referred to the sensitive nature of the poet as a whole and his inability to adapt to the real world. This results into the inability to react to paralyzing boredom.

              <p>
              The aim of the project is to extract knowledge from three poems of three different poets belonging to the same literary genre. We wanted to give an exhaustive overview of the literary current of Symbolism hence we chose its major expontents that are: Verlaine, Rimbaud and Mallarmé. In order to make it possible we created a specific ontology for the analysis of three poems, “Vocali” of Rimbaud, “Brezza Marina” of Mallarmè and “Arte Poetica” of Verlaine.  The choice fell on them since each of them is the most representative of its author. 
              We wanted to give the possibility to the user to navigate through the texts having the possibility to discover which themes and figures of speech are present and where. Hence, we started with the study of texts and all their characteristics.
